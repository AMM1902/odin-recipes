    <h1>Korean Fried Chicken</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Korean fried chicken, usually called chikin in Korea, refers to a variety of fried chicken dishes created in South Korea, including the basic huraideu-chicken and spicy yangnyeom chicken. In South Korea, fried chicken is consumed as a meal, an appetizer, anju, or as an after-meal snack.</p>
    <p>So what makes Korean fried chicken so different from its American counterpart? While its American cousin is usually brined and dredged in a flour and buttermilk mixture, Korean fried chicken tends to be more light and crispy with a thin, almost paper-like skin that is not heavily battered.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>(Yields <em>Four</em> servings)</p>
    <h3>Marinade</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, quartered</li>
